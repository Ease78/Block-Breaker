What&#39;s a GDD?

This is a living document that we will update as necessary during the development, most commonly by drawing ourselves a diagram before we dive into a complex implementation.

**A little bit of planning goes a long way, and can save us hours of re-working our code.**

Team and roles:

Description Of Game Design:

It&#39;s a simple block breaker game. Instead of breaking blocks the game will revolve around collecting minerals and gems.

The game should have a way of changing the direction of the ball depending on the angle.

Our Story/setting:

Space setting is the first thing to come to mind though it&#39;s overused.

Underground could be exiting sort of like minecraft. Underwater is something to consider (if you can explain the physics): (insert 2 paragraphs backstory)

Dr. Goldmort needs to dig for gold and other gems to replace his decaying teeth and perhaps make a golden nose to suit his greed. He doesn&#39;t care about environment and is using any means to get what he wants. His favorite way of digging is using dynamite and his trusted paddle/ball combo that lasted him years in the business. The adventure this time is in Nevada&#39;s famous goldstrike! Is our friend prepared for the tough mines? Rumor has it he was seen recruiting an evil army.

Creative Twists on Gameplay:

Powerups such as longer bar, double balls.

Adding a time limit, or a collision limit.

Having dynamite blocks with an explosion radius

Screen Mockups/Levels

Here is an example of what your game screen may look like. It consists of a simple image on a black background, and a single UI \&gt; Text element.
